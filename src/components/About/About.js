                <p>I am a web developer and recent graduate of the Web Developer bootcamp at Bloc. I love coding because there’s something exciting about bringing a project to life. And while it may be challenging at times, I’m always learning something new!

                    When I'm not coding, you can find me outdoors camping, playing the guitar, or practicing tae kwon do. Feel free to contact me or browse some of my projects.
